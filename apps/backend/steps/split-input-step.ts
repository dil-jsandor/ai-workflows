    Please split the following text into equally sized sections, each approximately 200â€“300 characters long.
    Try not to break sentences or paragraphs in the middle. The goal is to analyze each part separately later for potential security risks.
    As an answer strictly send me only a string array in json format where the elements should be the split string parts like {"results": ["section1", "section2"]}. The given text: ${input}`;
